# vision-transformer-classification

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for the classification of the CIFAR-10 dataset. While using a transformer for this task might be overkill due to the simplicity of CIFAR-10, this implementation serves as an illustrative example of how transformers can be applied to various image classification tasks.

*Note: The primary goal of this project is educational, showcasing the adaptability of transformers beyond their typical domains.*
